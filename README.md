## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=18)
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio / Xcode

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SmartHome
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the application:

For Android:
```bash
npm run android
```

For iOS:
```bash
npm run ios
```

## üìä Mock Data

The application includes comprehensive mock data for testing:

### Rooms
- Living Room (3 devices)
- Bedroom (2 devices)
- Kitchen (3 devices)
- Bathroom (1 device)
- Office (2 devices)

### Device Types
- **Lights**: Dimmable smart lights with brightness control
- **AC**: Air conditioning units with temperature control
- **TV**: Smart televisions
- **Fans**: Ceiling and portable fans
- **Cameras**: Security cameras
- **Doors**: Smart door locks

## üéØ Key Features Demo

### Device Control
- Tap device cards to toggle on/off
- For dimmable lights, tap to expand and adjust brightness
- Real-time status updates with visual indicators

### Room Navigation
- Select rooms from the dashboard
- View room-specific device grids
- Monitor room activity with progress bars

### Smart Filtering
- Filter by device type (All, Lights, AC, TV, Fans, Cameras)
- Filter by status (All, On, Off)
- Combined filtering for precise device selection

### Quick Actions
- **All Lights On**: Turn on all smart lights
- **All Lights Off**: Turn off all smart lights
